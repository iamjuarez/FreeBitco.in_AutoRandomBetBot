Winner script bets min a set number of times(betafter) before upping the bet to basebet. choose to bet only hi, only lo, or random by Math.random() *100 and what evers over 50 is hi under 49 is lo. multiplier is the game win percent. but you can change how it multiplys after losing the betafter amount by finding the betval* in the code.
